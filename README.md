# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-
Based on the “k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)” machine learning algorithm. I was implement a handwritten digit recognition system (from 0 to 9) in Python. The system make it possible to read a pre-recorded handwritten digit (offline recognition), preprocess it, analyze it then determine its class of membership.
